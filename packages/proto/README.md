# Prototype

This package is an HTML prototype of the Blazing Travels app.
This prototype is developed in modules 1-3 of the course, and
written entirely in static HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Later modules will develop this prototype into a full-stack app,
including an API server and client-rendered frontend.

## Running

To start the web server:

```shell
npm start
```
