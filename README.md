This repo contains the code for an the app, Blazing Travel, used
as an example of a client-rendered web app for CSC 437.

The example proceeds in stages the following stages, each of
which is developed as a separate workspace in this monorepo:

- [Prototype](packages/proto/README.md) uses only HTML/CSS
  static files.
- [Server](packages/server/README.md) adds a backend API and
  communication with a database.
- [App](packages/app/README.md) adds routing and state
  management to the frontend, making it a single-page app.
- [Mustang](packages/mustang/README.md) is a lightweight
  frontend framework which we use to demonstrate what frameworks
  do and how they can improve developer experience.
- [Testing](packages/testing/README.md) demonstrates different
  approaches to testing a web app.

Each module (week) of the course builds on the previous ones. In
this repo, there is a branch for each module so we can track the
progress:
