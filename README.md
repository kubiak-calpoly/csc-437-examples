This repo contains the code for an the app, Blazing Travel, used
as an example of a client-rendered web app for CSC 437.

The example proceeds in stages the following stages, each of
which is developed as a separate workspace in this monorepo. This
module only uses the following workspaces:

- [Prototype](packages/proto/README.md) uses only HTML/CSS
  static files.
- [Mustang](packages/mustang/README.md) is a lightweight
  frontend framework which we use to demonstrate what frameworks
  do and how they can improve developer experience.

Each module (week) of the course builds on the previous ones. In
this repo, there is a branch for each module so we can track the
progress:

- [Module 1](https://github.com/kubiak-calpoly/csc-437-examples/tree/mod-1):
  Information Architecture and HTML
- [Module 2](https://github.com/kubiak-calpoly/csc-437-examples/tree/sp24/mod-2):
  Styling with CSS
